|`Author` | Matei Maria Ioana Antonia 

## Components of the crawler robot:
1. Arduino board
2. Tracked chassis
3. Motor driver
4. Batteries
5. Sensors
6. Expansion board
7. Connecting wires

## 1. Environment Setup: I will start by installing the Arduino IDE on the computer so that I can write and upload the code to the Arduino board.
2. Connecting the Components: I will make sure that all the components are correctly connected: the motors to the motor driver, the driver to the Arduino, and the sensors to the appropriate ports.
3. Writing the Code:
   - Initialization: Defining the pins used for motors and sensors.
   - Motor Control: Writing functions to control the speed and direction of motors.
   - Reading Sensors: Implementing code to read data from sensors and make decisions based on it (for example, avoiding obstacles).
4. Testing and Debugging: After uploading the code to the Arduino, I will test the robot to verify proper operation. I will adjust the code or connections if necessary.
